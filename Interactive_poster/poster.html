        <p class="text1">On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you.</p>
        <p class="text2">I am a victim, I have no qualms with this word, only with the idea that it is all that I am.</p>
        <p class="text3">Do you solemnly swear... nothing but the truth,</p>
        <p class="text4">...but we don't know if it counts as assault yet.</p>
        <p class="text5">My dream is to write children's books. I felt no parent is going to want me as a role model if I'm just the discarded, drunk, half-naked body behind a dumpster.</p>
        <p class="text6">I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation</p>
